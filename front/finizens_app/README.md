# FinizensApp - Diego Garc√≠a

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

## Before to start the project
Please take note of the `environment.ts` file, where you can find the `api_url` property. During development, I created a local domain, which is why the URL is set to `http://finizens-dev.com/api`. Feel free to change it to suit your needs.

## Steps to setup project

In order to setup the project you should follow the next steps:

- Copy .env.example file and rename it to .env. This file already has sample Database credentials.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start`.
- You're done! Now the project is ready to use it.
